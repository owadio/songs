**B** is for born to fly
**O** is for on the go
**R** is for ready
**N** is for never quit
**E** is for everything

Down by the river
Took a little walk
Ran into some terrorist
Had a little talk

We push them (YAH!)
We Kick them (YAH!)
We push them kick them (YAH YAH!)
Into to the river
Left them to drown

We don't need no terrorist
Hanging around
