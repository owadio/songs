# C-130

C130 rolling down the street
Viper warriors took a little trip
Stand up, hook it up, shuffle to the door
Jump right out by the count of four

Oh wa eh ya
Left right eh ya
Oh wa eh ya
Viper eh ya

If my shoot doesn’t open wide
I got a spare one by my side
If that one doesn’t open too
Oh hard ground I am coming for you

If I land in the Russian Front
Bury me with a Russian gun
If I land in the Vietnam War
Send me back to Singapore

If I land in Sentosa,
Send me back by cable car
If I land in the Old Folk’s Home
Pack me up and send me home

Tell my mom I’ve done my best
Now its time for me to rest
Tell my girl I’ve done my best
Silver wings upon my chest.
