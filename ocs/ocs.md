# Officer (OCS) Song

## Verse 1
We come from many places, all across the land
Of many different races, together hand in hand
United we stand, divided we fall
Ready to serve our nation’s call

## Chorus
We come from OCS
We are the very best
Leading with dignity and pride
Wherever we go, we will always know
Our spirit lives forevermore

## Verse 2
Loyalty to country, that’s what we all believe
To lead, excel and overcome, is what we must achieve
Forever strong and valiant, we’ll give our lives and more
Never ceasing to serve Singapore

## Chorus
We come from OCS
We are the very best
Leading with dignity and pride
Wherever we go, we will always know
Our spirit lives forevermore
