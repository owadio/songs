# Left Toe Right Toe

Left toe right toe, keep up the tempo
Left toe right toe, way-loh way-loh ah

Here we go again
Same old march again
Up and down this avenue
X more days and weâ€™ll be through

X more days to book out day
Book out book out day
Way-loh way-loh way-loh way-loh, ah ah
Way-loh way-loh way-loh way-loh, ooh ah ah

Up the hill
Down the slope
Up the slope
Down the hill

Any sweat?
No sweat, chicken feet ha ha
All the way
