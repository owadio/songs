# When The Whistle Blows

When the whistle blows
Silence everywhere
And the flag goes up
In the battalion square

Soldiers all around
Never let you down
‘Cos we are the best
In the SAF

So echo echo out loud
Viper warriors never let you down yah
So echo echo out loud
Viper warriors never let you down yah

Up in the sky
Where the planes fly high
And the parachutes bloom
Like flowers in the sky

I wanna be
A [x] Coy! warrior
‘Cos we are the best
In the SAF
