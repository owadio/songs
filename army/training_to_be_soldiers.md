# Training To Be Soldiers

## Verse 1
Training to be soldiers
Fight for our land
Once in our lives
Two years of our time

## Chorus
Have you ever wondered?
Why must we serve?
Because we love our land
And we want it to be free to be free yeah!

## Verse 2
Looking all around us
People everywhere
Children having fun
While we are holding guns

## Outro
Stand up
Be on your guard
Come on everybody
Do your part
Come on every soldier
Soul and heart
Do it for our nation
Do it for our Singapore
