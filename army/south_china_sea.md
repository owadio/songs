# South China Sea

Far, far away in the South China Sea, ya
I left
A girl
With tears in her eyes

I must go where the brave men died ya
A soldier has to fight the front because he loves his land ya
A soldier has to fight even if he has to die
Cause we are the ones who hold the guns
We are the ones who fight the front

(We are mighty warriors of our land ya)
[Coy name] warriors marching in hurrah, hurrah
[Coy name] warriors marching in, hurrah, hurrah
Cause we are the ones who hold the guns
We are the ones who fight the front
We are mighty warriors of our land YA!
