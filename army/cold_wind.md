# Cold Wind

In the early morning march
With a fieldback on my back
And an aching in my heart
And my body full of sweat

I'm a long long way from home
And I miss my mama so

In the early morning march
When the cold wind blows
When the cold wind blows
When the cold wind blows
When the cold wind blows

I know I know
You have to go
So hurry back home
I miss you so
