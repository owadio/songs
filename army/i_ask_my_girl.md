# I Ask My Girl

I ask my girl
To take a Walk
To take a Walk
Down Orchard Road
Bypass Mandarin
To Centrepoint
Where we had lunch
At MacDonalds'

We had fillet
And an apple pie
We shared a cup
Of Lemon Lime
I held her hands (Holding her hands)
Look into her eyes
I asked her to
Be my valentine (Be my future wife)

There was one night
There was no light
There was no light
So we used torchlight
Torchlight no light
So we used star light
Star light not bright
So we used Purple Light
