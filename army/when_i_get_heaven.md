# When I Get to Heaven

When I get to Heaven
The angel’s gonna ask me
How I got to Heaven
How I found my way here

I reply with a little bit of anger
Earned my way as a [Coy name] warrior
Living my life full of blood sweat danger
That’s the way of a [Coy name] warrior

When I get to Hell
The devil’s gonna ask me
How I got to Hell
How I found my way here

I reply with my dirty little finger
Earned my way as a [Coy name] warrior
Living my life full of blood sweat danger
That’s the way of a [Coy name] warrior
